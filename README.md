# 100DaysOfCode

This repository will contain my logs for the challenge of #100daysofCode. The initial idea is to build User interfaces, web applications as well as Dapps using the latest technologies.

At the end of the challenge, I would be familier with the advanced UI development as well as creating services using the serverless cloud apps and APIs.
