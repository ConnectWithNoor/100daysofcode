## 🙋‍♂️ #100DaysOfCode Challenge - Motivation

The realization that I need to keep myself updated with the cutting edge technologies made me start the challenge. I am a software engineer working as a Frontend ReactJS developer for 2 years, but want to explore frameworks and tools that I've been missing so far. Basically, I am shifting towards full-stack developer and this challege is itself a milestone to my target.

At the end of the challenge, I would be familier with the advanced UI development as well as creating services using the serverless cloud apps and APIs.

## 🚀 Worked on Tools and Frameworks :
